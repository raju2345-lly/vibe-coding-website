## Risk Mitigation Plan

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Embed Platform Changes
**Impact**: Social media platforms could change embed policies
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Use public embed URLs (most stable)
- Implement fallback to direct links if embeds fail
- Monitor platform terms of service changes
- Test embeds regularly for functionality
- Keep platform links as backup

#### Risk 2: Content Availability
**Impact**: Limited initial content could affect user engagement
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Start with placeholder/demo content for website launch
- Manual curation of viral videos for preview
- Content creation handled separately in Step 6
- Website can launch before content pipeline is ready
- Use free sample content initially

#### Risk 3: Embed Loading Performance
**Impact**: Slow embed loading could hurt user experience and SEO
**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Lazy loading for video embeds (load only when visible)
