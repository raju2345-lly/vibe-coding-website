# Git Safety Rules for AI Agents

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: ALL GIT OPERATIONS REQUIRE EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION

**NEVER perform git operations without explicit user permission:**
- **NEVER** commit changes without asking user permission first
- **NEVER** push to remote repositories without explicit user instruction
- **NEVER** create branches without explicit user approval
- **NEVER** switch branches unless explicitly instructed
- **ALWAYS** ask: "May I commit these changes locally?" before any git operation
- **ALWAYS** ask for confirmation before any branch operations
- **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**: Update files only, no git operations unless explicitly approved

**Before ANY git operation:**
1. Ask: "May I commit these changes locally?"
2. Wait for explicit user approval
3. Only proceed if user says "yes" or "approved"

**Standard workflow:**
- Work on current branch unless told otherwise
- Local commits ONLY with explicit permission
- NEVER push without explicit instruction
- Ask permission before EVERY git command
