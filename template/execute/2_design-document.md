# Step 2: Design Document with Staged Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Create a detailed design document that breaks the project into manageable stages, with specific to-do lists for each stage.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- [ ] Completed clarifying questions session
- [ ] Requirements document approved (`output/docs/requirements/website-prd.md`)
- [ ] 95% confidence in understanding requirements

## ðŸ¤– AI Instructions

### Phase 1: Create Design Document

#### Step 1.1: Project Summary
Create `output/docs/strategy/design-document.md`:

```markdown
# Website Design Document

## Project Overview
[2-3 paragraph summary of the project based on requirements]

## Goals & Success Metrics
- Primary Goal: [from requirements]
- KPIs: [specific metrics]
- Timeline: [launch date]
```

#### Step 1.2: Break Into Implementation Stages

**IMPORTANT: Separate the implementation into 3-5 logical stages**

```markdown
## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation Setup (Days 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish project infrastructure and core components

#### To-Do List:
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS and design system
- [ ] Set up folder structure and routing
- [ ] Create reusable UI components
- [ ] Implement responsive navigation
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Create base layouts

#### Success Criteria:
- Development environment running
- Basic navigation working
- Component library established

### Stage 2: Core Features (Days 4-7)
**Goal**: Implement primary functionality

#### To-Do List:
- [ ] Build landing page with hero section
- [ ] Implement service/product pages
- [ ] Create contact forms with validation
- [ ] Add WhatsApp integration
- [ ] Implement SEO meta tags
- [ ] Set up Google Analytics
- [ ] Create 404 and error pages
- [ ] Add loading states

#### Success Criteria:
- All core pages functional
- Forms submitting correctly
- Analytics tracking events

### Stage 3: Content & Optimization (Days 8-10)
**Goal**: Add content and optimize performance

#### To-Do List:
- [ ] Populate all content sections
- [ ] Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- [ ] Implement schema markup
- [ ] Add Open Graph tags
- [ ] Create XML sitemap
- [ ] Optimize Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Add PWA capabilities
- [ ] Implement caching strategies

#### Success Criteria:
- Lighthouse score > 90
- All content populated
- SEO fully optimized

### Stage 4: Testing & Polish (Days 11-12)
**Goal**: Ensure quality and user experience

#### To-Do List:
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness check
- [ ] Form submission testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG)
- [ ] Security headers setup
- [ ] Error handling improvement
- [ ] User acceptance testing

#### Success Criteria:
- No critical bugs
- Passes all quality checks
- Client approval received
```

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture

#### Step 2.1: Technology Stack Documentation

```markdown
## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context / Zustand
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Package Manager**: npm/yarn/pnpm
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
```

#### Step 2.2: Risk Mitigation Plan

```markdown
## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Regular Lighthouse audits
   - Fallback: CDN and caching strategies

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement
   - Fallback: Polyfills for older browsers

3. **SEO Visibility**
   - Mitigation: SSG/SSR approach
   - Fallback: Static generation for all pages

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict stage boundaries
   - Fallback: Move features to Phase 2

2. **Testing Delays**
   - Mitigation: Test during development
   - Fallback: Prioritize critical paths
```

### Phase 3: Human Approval Checkpoint

#### Step 3.1: Present Design Document
**Show the complete design document to human vibecoder**

Questions to ask:
1. "Does this staged approach align with your priorities?"
2. "Should we adjust the timeline for any stage?"
3. "Are there any missing critical features?"
4. "Do you approve moving to implementation?"

#### Step 3.2: Document Approval
```bash
# Create approval record
echo "Design Document Approved: $(date)" > output/docs/strategy/approval-log.md
echo "Approved by: [Human Vibecoder Name]" >> output/docs/strategy/approval-log.md
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics
- Design document created with clear stages
- Each stage has detailed to-do lists
- Human vibecoder approves the plan
- Ready to proceed to Stage 1 implementation

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps
After approval, proceed to Step 3: Implementation Stages
