## 🎯 Purpose
Publish and distribute approved content across multiple channels for maximum reach and engagement, with human-guided checklist completion for quality assurance.

## 🚨 CRITICAL PREREQUISITES
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE - DO NOT SKIP:**
1. ✅ Content created and approved from Step 7
2. ✅ Website must be built and tested FIRST
3. ⚠️ **REQUIRES**: Run `@template/execute/3_implementation-stages.md` to add content to website
4. ⚠️ **REQUIRES**: Run `@template/execute/4_testing-validation.md` to test website with new content
5. ✅ Only AFTER website is updated and tested, proceed with distribution

## 📋 Input Validation Requirements
**AI must check these files exist before proceeding:**
- [ ] `input/website-requirement.md` - Business context
- [ ] `input/content-requirement.md` - Content strategy
- [ ] `output/docs/requirements/website-prd.md` - Product requirements
- [ ] `output/content/strategy/content-strategy.md` - Master content strategy

## 🤖 AI Instructions

### Phase 0: Critical Pre-Distribution Setup

#### Step 0.1: Validate Current Environment
**MANDATORY CHECKS:**
```bash
# Check if website exists and is running
if [ ! -d "output/website" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Website not built. Must run Step 3 first."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if content exists
if [ ! -f "output/content/production/*/final-article.md" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: No approved content found. Must complete Step 7 first."
    exit 1
fi

# Check website status
echo "🔍 Checking website status..."
echo "Website directory exists: ✅"
echo "Next step: Add content to website via Step 3"
```

#### Step 0.2: Extract Contact Information from Requirements
**CRITICAL**: AI must find real contact information from input files:
```bash
# Extract WhatsApp number from website-requirement.md
WHATSAPP_NUMBER=$(grep -o "91816795" input/website-requirement.md)
if [ -z "$WHATSAPP_NUMBER" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: WhatsApp number not found in requirements"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Found WhatsApp: $WHATSAPP_NUMBER"

# Extract business details from PRD
BUSINESS_NAME=$(grep "BeyondSGProp" output/docs/requirements/website-prd.md)
if [ -z "$BUSINESS_NAME" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Business name not found in PRD"
    exit 1
